        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <div class="about-content">
            <p>I'm a learning designer who believes effective adult learning combines evidence-based instructional design with psychological safety and inclusive practice.</p>

            <p>My journey started with educational psychology—studying how people learn, what motivates behavior change, and how to create environments where learning thrives. I taught English to diverse adult learners across cultural contexts, earning my DELTA qualification and discovering my passion for designing learning experiences, not just delivering them.</p>

            <p>This led me to programme design and facilitation, where I combined instructional design frameworks with my psychology background. I've designed CPD-accredited training programmes achieving 95%+ satisfaction, led trauma-informed co-design with vulnerable communities, and developed learning resources for adult professionals.</p>

            <h2>What sets my work apart</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Educational psychology expertise:</strong> Evidence-based understanding of how adults learn</li>
                <li><strong>Trauma-informed practice:</strong> Creating psychologically safe environments where all learners can thrive</li>
                <li><strong>Instructional design rigor:</strong> ADDIE, Bloom's Taxonomy, assessment design, evaluation frameworks</li>
                <li><strong>Facilitation mastery:</strong> Building trust, managing group dynamics, responsive adaptation</li>
                <li><strong>AI capabilities:</strong> Leveraging generative AI to enhance (not replace) human-centered learning</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>I'm particularly passionate about</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Designing learning experiences for diverse adult populations</li>
                <li>Creating inclusive, accessible learning that honors different learning needs</li>
                <li>Working collaboratively with subject matter experts and faculty</li>
                <li>Measuring impact beyond satisfaction scores—real behavior change and results</li>
                <li>Making trauma-informed practice accessible to learning professionals</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Currently, I'm contributing to UX for Change developing trauma-informed learning resources and exploring how AI can enhance learning design while maintaining human connection at the center.</p>

            <p>I'm seeking opportunities to bring rigorous instructional design and trauma-informed facilitation to adult learning contexts—whether corporate training, higher education, professional development, or EdTech.</p>
